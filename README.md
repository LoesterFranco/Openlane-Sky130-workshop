# Openlane-Sky130-workshop
An informative workshop on advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130 organized by VSD Corp. It helped me gain hands-on experience full ASIC implementation steps from RTL to GDSII using Google-Skywater's first manufacturable open source 130nm process design kit. The workshop focused on building basics by imparting exposure to conceptual as well as practical approach.Learnings: Design Exploration, Logic Equivalence Check (LEC), Antenna Diode Concept, Decoupling Cap, Pin Placement, Timing Characterization and familiarity with files like libs/db,LEF,DEF,SDC and SPEF. Tools used: Magic, ngspice, OpenSTA, TritonRoute, yosys and OpenROAD.
